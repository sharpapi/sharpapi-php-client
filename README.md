## Installation

1. You can install the package via composer:

composer require sharpapi/sharpapi-php-client
```

2. Register at [SharpAPI.com](https://sharpapi.com/) and get the API key.

3. **That's it!**

## Usage

### Simple example

```php
$sharpApi = new \SharpAPI\SharpApiService\SharpApiService(SHARP_API_KEY);

$statusUrl = $sharpApi->productCategories(
        'Lenovo Chromebook Laptop (2023), 14" FHD Touchscreen Slim 3, 
        8-Core MediaTek Kompanio 520 CPU, 4GB RAM, 128GB Storage',
        'German', // optional language
        400, // optional quantity
        'optional neutral voice tone', // optional voice tone
        'optional current e-store categories'     // optional context, current categories to match
    );

$resultSharpApiJob = $sharpApi->fetchResults($statusUrl);

var_dump($resultSharpApiJob->getResultJson());
```

Typical use case require these steps:

1. Dispatch one of the available AI processing methods (this will return job processing status URL)
2. Run `fetchResults($statusUrl)` method which operates in polling mode, sending underneath
   requests every 10 seconds for 180 seconds (these values can be customized,
   check `SharpApiService` source code).
3. `SharpApiJob` object will be returned.
4. For a job finished with `success` return status you can obtain the results with one
   of the methods, for example `$jobResultJson = $jobResult->getResultJson()`.

**Each dispatched job usually takes somewhere between a couple of seconds to a minute.**

After that period a returned job will usually have `success` status and it's results will
be available for further processing.
Each API method returns different return format.
[Go to List of API methods/endpoints below for details&raquo;](#list-of-api-methodsendpoints)

**Our API guarantees to return correct format every time.** AI engines that SharpAPI
use in rare cases have a tendency to misbehave and timeout
or return incorrect data.
In those cases the returned `status` for the job will be `failed`.
You can rerun the exact same job request in that case.

As long as the job is still being processed by our engine it will keep
returning `pending` status.

### Guzzle Exceptions

Underlying HTTP requests are powered with Guzzle,
so it's a good idea to check for
typical [Guzzle Exceptions](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/quickstart.html#exceptions):

```php
use GuzzleHttp\Exception\ClientException;

// Step 1: dispatch the job to the API with one of the methods, for example:
try {
    $statusUrl = \SharpApiService::summarizeText(
        $text, 
        'German' // optional language
        500, // optional length
        'neutral'  // optional voice tone
      );
    // $statusUrl example value: 'https://sharpapi.com/api/v1/job/status/75acb6dc-a975-4969-9ef1-c62cebc511cb'
} catch (ClientException $e) {
     $e->getResponse()
}

// Step 2: request to check job status in polling mode and wait for the result
$jobResult = \SharpApiService::fetchResults($statusUrl);

// Step 3: get results of dispatched API job, f.e. this returns job result as a prettied JSON
$jobResultJson = $jobResult->getResultJson();
// ..or PHP array:
$jobResultArray = $jobResult->getResultArray();
// ..or PHP stdClass:
$jobResultObject = $jobResult->getResultObject();
```

### Framework Controller usage example

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use GuzzleHttp\Exception\GuzzleException;
use SharpAPI\SharpApiService\SharpApiService;

class SharpTest extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(public SharpApiService $sharpApiService)
    {
    }

    /**
     * @throws GuzzleException
     */
    public function detect_phones(): void
    {
        $statusUrl = $this->sharpApiService->detectPhones(
            'Where to find us? Call with a sales tech advisor:
            Call: 1800-394-7486 or our Singapore office +65 8888 8888'
        );
        
        $result = $this->sharpApiService->fetchResults($statusUrl);
        
        dd($result->getResultJson());
        /* returned:
        [
            {
                "detected_number": "1800-394-7486",
                "parsed_number": "+18003947486"
            },
            {
                "detected_number": "+65 8888 8888",
                "parsed_number": "+6588888888"
            }
        ]
         */
    }
}
```

## üìã List of API methods/endpoints
